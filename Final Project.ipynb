    "#    - We then convert the entire column to lowercase and remove all leading/trailing whitespace\n",
    "#      to ensure the keyword search works consistently (e.g., \"Close To\" becomes \"close to\").\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 2. Create Two Keyword Lists:\n",
    "#    - We created 'limited_keywords' (e.g., \"far from\", \"need to walk\")\n",
    "#    - We also created 'accessible_keywords' (e.g., \"metro\", \"close to\", \"bus station\")\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 3. Classify with a \"Scoring\" Function:\n",
    "#    - This function is more advanced. It \"scores\" the description.\n",
    "#    - It counts how many times any 'limited_' keyword appears.\n",
    "#    - It counts how many times any 'accessible_' keyword appears.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# 4. Compare the Scores:\n",
    "#    - If a description is empty, it defaults to \"Limited Transportation\" (a safe assumption).\n",
    "#    - If 'accessible_count' is higher than 'limited_count', it's classified as \"Accessible\".\n",
    "#    - If 'limited_count' is higher (or if the scores are equal), it's classified as \"Limited\".\n",
